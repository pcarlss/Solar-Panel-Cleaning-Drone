# Solar Panel Cleaning Drone
Drone system developed by a team of 7 Concordia University students to transport and deploy a cleaning bot for efficient rooftop solar panel maintenance.

# Overview
This project is developed by a team of seven students from Concordia University, consisting of five Aerospace Engineering students and two Computer Engineering students. Our goal is to design and develop an autonomous system that utilizes a drone to transport and deploy a cleaning bot for rooftop solar panels. The drone delivers the cleaning bot to the rooftop, where it automatically cleans the solar panels, ensuring maximum efficiency by removing dust and debris. The project involves a combination of drone navigation, robotic automation, and sensor integration to create a fully autonomous cleaning solution.
